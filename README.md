## Description
- A recreation of the Avengers Endgame final battle scene in Unity with autonomous agents and 3D models. 
- There have been adjustments in the storyline and scenes due to unavailable 3D models and time.
- The spaceships and models apply behaviours such as path following, steering, banking, fleeing, pursue and offset pursue; and animations, written and applied in code.
- The spaceships were created in Blender, the models were taken from Sketchfab and RenderHub, and the animations from Mixamo.
