## Description
A recreation of the Avengers Endgame final battle scene in Unity with autonomous agents and 3D models. 

There have been adjustments in the storyline and scenes due to unavailable 3D models and time.

The spaceships and models apply behaviours such as path following, steering, banking, fleeing, pursue and offset pursue; and animations, written and applied in code.

The sequence manager handles the sequences.

The spaceships were created in Blender, the models were taken from Sketchfab and the animations from Mixamo.
